      "explanations": {
        "a": "MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol, but HTTP is used for data transfer in this case.",
        "b": "HTTP is the protocol used to send sensor data to IoT platforms in this experiment.",
        "c": "TCP is a transport layer protocol, not typically used for IoT data transfer directly.",
        "d": "FTP is used for file transfers, not for sending live data in IoT applications."

      "question": "What is the role of the ESP8266/ESP32 in this experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To process the sensor data",
        "b": "To connect to the IoT platform and send the data",
        "c": "To power the sensors",
        "d": "To store the data locally"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The ESP8266/ESP32 does not process data; it sends it to the IoT platform.",
        "b": "The ESP8266/ESP32 connects to the internet and sends sensor data to the cloud platform using HTTP.",
        "c": "The ESP8266/ESP32 powers the sensors through its GPIO pins, but it doesn't store data locally.",
        "d": "The ESP8266/ESP32 does not store data locally; it sends it to the cloud for remote access."
